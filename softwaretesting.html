				<h1>Software testing</h1>
				<p>I can call myself a happy person at least because I have found something for myself that can bring me both pleasure and income.<br>
					<br>
				 I can say that in the field of quality control and testing I am recently but nevertheless during this short time I managed to get into the work and feel that this is really mine.<br>
				 <br>
				 Over the past three months I have completed courses and internships in automated testing. At the moment, I continue to develop in this direction and attend courses on testing in another company.
